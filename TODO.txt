=== Game

=== Code
-- Improve the build: have more errors, warning shown and stuff like that

=== Current Goal
-- ...

=== Stuff that workd but i need to fix it 
-- Remove "this_is_a_part_of_not_having_branes" inside fix_camera_world_invariant and update it better
-- Compile into a dll for more convinient reload

=== Ideas
-- Have a sym_region be a region that gets simulated based on something, for example a player. 
   Have a camera region be similar to sym_region but it will be used for drawing, 
   it then can be aplyid to different entities i guess.
   Both of them can have a similar scheme for local F32 type storage and them World_pos for global pos of reference
