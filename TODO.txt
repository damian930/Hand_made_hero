=== Current Goal


=== Stuff that workd but i need to fix it 
-- Collission is sometimes buggy
-- Draw entities better (Partial drawing)
-- Remove "this_is_a_part_of_not_having_branes" inside fix_camera_world_invariant and update it better
-- Compile into a dll for more convinient reload

=== Ideas
-- Have a sym_region be a region that gets simulated based on something, for example a player. 
   Have a camera region be similar to sym_region but it will be used for drawing, 
   it then can be aplyid to different entities i guess.
   Both of them can have a similar scheme for local F32 type storage and them World_pos for global pos of reference
   
-- Maybe reserve entity index 0 or something for the single player and then have the camera
      follow a specific entity, this way camera following can be chaged easily. 
      I dont like this since when we have to deal with special indexes, but maybe having a flag 
      for it is not that bad. Dont know. But player as an entity is must have i guess.
