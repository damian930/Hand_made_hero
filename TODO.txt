=== Some code stuff
-- Remove "pragma once" and use some ifdefs for header includes

=== Platform
-- Compile the game code into a dll and reload when compiled for eaiser usage

=== Game
-- Start having the map be generated using a hash map or something
-- Start basing stuf from the miffle like minecraft insted of the left lower corner
-- Add couple of hard coded entities

-- KINDA (it doesnt stick no more, but it doesnt slide for some reason) | Change the direction of vectors when colliding with tiles to remove the sticking problem
-- Start having entities (walls for example)
-- Introduce gravity, need a player to fall

===
-- Need a better way to store coordinate on the map
-- Colision is bad sometimes now, GJK sometimes fucks up

=== Current Goal
